        This document aims to specify behavior for the DOM <code>innerText</code> property.

    <section id="intro" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <code>innerText</code> was introduced by Internet Explorer but never specified in any
        official document. It was later implemented (incompatibly) by Webkit; this implementation
        was inherited by Blink. The intent of <code>innerText</code>, as it has evolved, seems to
        be to return the "rendered text" of an element, similar to what browsers produce when
        equivalent HTML content is copied to the clipboard as plaintext.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no "one true way" to convert HTML, or rich text in general, to plain text.
        Such conversion can generally be implemented effectively in Javascript with existing DOM APIs.
        Therefore, there is no need to have this feature in the Web platform, and we might
        be better off if it was delegated to libraries. However, <code>innerText</code> is
        implemented in popular browsers and is used by many Web sites. Therefore it should be
        specified. Currently the goal is to produce a reasonably simple specification that is
        Web-compatible and that browser vendors are willing to implement.
      </p>
      <p>
        For consistency, <code>Selection.toString()</code> should be defined the same way.
      </p>

      <h2>Setting <code>innerText</code></h2>
      The innerText IDL attribute is a DOMString on the HTMLElement interface.
      <p>
        The original intent of the <code>innerText</code> setter seems to be that setting an HTML element's <code>innerText</code>
        to a string will render that string visually. To that end, both Chrome and Edge (as of October 2015)
        convert <code>\n</code> and <code>\r</code> characters to <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> elements.
        They also both convert a <code>\r\n</code> pair to a single
        <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>. Edge goes further, converting some whitespace characters to <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> to avoid
        whitespace trimming and collapsing &mdash; but Chrome does not.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is already a simple and completely accurate way to have an HTML element render a string as-is:
        make the element <code>white-space:pre</code> and set its <code>textContent</code>. Therefore
        we specify <code>innerText</code> to do the simplest thing compatible with what browsers do,
        i.e. Chrome's behavior. So <code>innerText</code> replaces the child nodes of the element with
        new child nodes created as follows, processing the string in order:
        <ol>
        <li>For each run of text not including <code>\r</code> or <code>\n</code>, create a text node containing that text.
        <li>For each <code>\r\n</code> character pair, create a <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> element.
        <li>For each <code>\r</code> or <code>\n</code> not part of a <code>\r\n</code> character pair, create a <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> element.
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p><pre class="example highlight">&lt;p id='e'&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
e.innerText = "Hello\nkitty";
var s = e.innerHTML; // "Hello&lt;br&gt;kitty"
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

      <h2>Getting <code>innerText</code></h2>
      <p>
        The intent here seems to be that getting an element's <code>innerText</code>
        returns its text "as rendered". All browsers seem to have implemented a different set of heuristics
        for approximating that, typically approximating some subset of CSS processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can avoid specifying processing rules that duplicate and approximate some subset of CSS
        by specifying <code>innerText</code>'s getter in terms of the rendered text produced by CSS
        layout of the element. This won't work for elements which have no CSS boxes (e.g.
        <code>display:none</code> elements and elements not in a document), but Webkit/Blink
        already bail out for those elements and just return their <code>textContent</code>, so we can
        follow suit. So:
        <ol>
        <li>If the element is <code>display:none</code> or not in a document with a browsing context,
        return the same value as the element's <code>textContent</code>.
        <li>Compute a list of items each of which may be a string or a "required line break count",
        a positive integer, by applying the following recursive procedure to each child node of the element in DOM
        order and concatenating the results. (Intuitively, a "required line break count" item means that a certain
        number of line breaks must appear at that point, but they can be collapsed with the line breaks induced
        by adjacent "required line break count" items, reminiscient to CSS margin-collapsing.)
          <ol>
          <li>If the node is an <code>&lt;rp&gt;</code> element, let <em>items</em> be
          a list containing a single item containing the node's <code>textContent</code>,
          otherwise let <em>items</em> be the result of recursively applying this procedure to each
          child of the node and concatenating the results (producing a list of items).
          <li>If the node has no associated CSS box, return <em>items</em>. (Note:
          <em>items</em> may be non-empty due to <code>display:contents</code>.)
          <li>If the node's computed value of <code>visibility</code> is <code>hidden</code>,
          return <em>items</em>.
          <li>If the node is a text node, then for each CSS text box produced by the node,
          in content order, compute the text of the box after application of the CSS white-space
          processing rules and text-transform rules (sections 4 and 2 of CSS3 Text), and
          return a list of the resulting strings. The CSS white-space
          processing rules are slightly modified: collapsible spaces at the end of lines
          are always collapsed, but they are only removed if the line is the last line of the block, or it ends with a
          <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> element. Soft hyphens should be preserved.
          <li>If the node is a <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>,
          append a string containing a single newline character to <em>items</em>.
          <li>If the node's computed value of <code>display</code> is <code>table-cell</code>,
          and the node's CSS box is not the last table-cell box of its enclosing table-row box,
          append a string containing a single tab character to <em>items</em>.
          <li>If the node's computed value of <code>display</code> is <code>table-row</code>,
          and the node's CSS box is not the last table-row box of the nearest ancestor items-table box,
          append a string containing a single newline character to <em>items</em>.
          <li>If the node is a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element, add a "required line break count of 2" item
          at the beginning and end of <em>items</em>.
          <li>If the node's used value of <code>display</code> is "block-level" (see CSS3
          Display) or <code>table-caption</code>, add a "required line break count of 1" item at the
          beginning and end of <em>items</em>. (Note: floats and absolutely-positioned elements
          fall into this category.)
          <li>Return <em>items</em>.
          </ol>
        <li>Delete any string items whose strings are empty.
        <li>Delete any runs of consecutive "required line break count" items at the
        start or end of the list.
        <li>Replace each remaining run of consecutive "required line break count" items with a string
        consisting of as many newline characters as the maximum of the values in the "required line
        break count" items.
        <li>Return the concatenation of the string items.
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>Note that descendant nodes of most replaced elements (e.g. <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>,
      <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> --- but not <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>)
      are not rendered by CSS, strictly speaking, and therefore have no CSS boxes for the purposes
      of this algorithm.
      <p>This algorithm is amenable to being generalized to work on a <code>Range</code>.
      Then we can use it as the basis for <code>Selection.toString()</code> and optionally
      expose it directly on <code>Range</code>.
      <p>In this algorithm, processing of text nodes is heavily CSS-based but processing of
      elements is mainly based on DOM structure and the computed value of <code>display</code>.
      Alternatively we could replace DOM traversal with traversal of the CSS boxes generated
      by the element and its descendants. For example, that approach would naturally lead to
      generated content and shadow DOM content being included in <code>innerText</code>, while
      the above algorithm naturally excludes such content. That approach seems likely to be
      less Web-compatible than the above algorithm, more surprising for Web developers in
      edge cases, and no simpler than the above algorithm.
      <p>This algorithm is depends on computed styles and on layout (due to <code>::first-line</code>
      affecting <code>text-transform</code> --- <code>::first-line</code> and <code>::first-letter</code>
      styles are implicitly honoured. Avoiding dependence on layout would add implementation
      complexity (to Gecko, at least), because it's tricky to compute the correct styles
      for text as if first-line did not apply.
      <p>Special handling of <code>&lt;rp&gt;</code> is not in Chrome and probably not needed
      for Web compatibility. However the entire point of the <code>&lt;rp&gt;</code> element is
      to make plaintext rendering of ruby intelligible, so it seems churlish to not support it.
      <p><pre class="example highlight">&lt;p id='e'&gt;Hello
   kitty
&lt;script&gt;
var s = e.innerText; // "Hello kitty"
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
      <p><pre class="example highlight">&lt;pre id='e'&gt;Hello
   kitty
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
var s = e.innerText; // "Hello\n   kitty\n"
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
